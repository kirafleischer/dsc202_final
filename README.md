## Overview 
We hope to develop an application that can help us gain insights into the film industry by focusing on two main use cases:
- Movie Recommendations 
  - Similarity based on genre, determined using a graph database
  - Similarity based on content, determined using a vector database
- Modeling Actor-Director Collaborations
  - Determine which collaborations lead to highest-rated films

### `actor-directors.ipynb` 
This file contains queries for our second use-case: modeling actor-director collaborations and their associated film ratings. This file also contains additional PostgreSQL queries showing future work we could do into gaining insights about the film industry.
